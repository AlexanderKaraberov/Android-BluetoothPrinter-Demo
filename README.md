# Android-BluetoothPrinter-Demo

Demo project shows how to print custom barcodes using Zonerich AB-330M Bluetooth printer. I use [this manual](http://www.mangohelp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/AB-320M-AB-330M-en-qq.pdf) for print commands (GS, K, W, etc.). Commands have to be sent as single bytes after GS command. E.g. GS -> set height comand K - > height value.
